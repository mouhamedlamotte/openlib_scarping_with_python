        "description": "Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her mother\u2019s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called \u201ccalorie restriction,\u201d eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, \u201cYour eyelashes are invisible, okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn\u2019t tint hers?\u201d She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.\n",
